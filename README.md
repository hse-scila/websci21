Providing access to diverse populations and being cost-efficient,
online experiments have been widely used to solve various problems
in social sciences. This research method has been especially
prevalent in Web science and digital communication research allowing
to study human interactions with and within the Web environment.
Among all, online experiments have been used to explore online
behaviour, information perception, social media use, to name a few.
However, such designs raise a number of methodological challenges —
both conceptual and technical.

This workshop (hosted by the 13th Web Science Conference 2021) is
dedicated to the methodology of online experiments. It will bring
together researchers from various fields with an expertise in online
experimental designs who will present their studies and share
experience in methodological problem solving. The goal of the
workshop is to discuss different approaches towards designing
Web-based experiments as well as their affordances and limitations.

The event will start from the presentation given by the
organizers: the SCILa team will share its experience of
conducting a cross-national online experiment based on the
recent [study on the perception of fake news in three countries](https://scila.hse.ru/en/fakenews).
In particular, we will discuss possible factorial designs,
representative sample construction, recruitment via targeting
tools on social media, and online experiment interface
development and testing. Followed by the presentations of other
panelists, the workshop will end with an extensive discussion
session where participants will have an opportunity to advise
each other and exchange broader ideas on the use of experiments
in Web science.

## Program

The estimated time of the workshop is between 3 and 4 hours. The
detailed program will be announced after the review of
applications is finished.

## Who can apply

### Panelists

We will select up to 5 participants who will present their
research during the workshop. The application needs to meet
several requirements:

- study is based on an online experiment as a primary method;
- data has been already collected;
- projects that are relevant to the thematic areas of the WebSci conference are strongly encouraged.

The proposed presentations are expected to cover methodological
aspects of online experiments such as but not limited to: choice
of a design; sample construction and methods of recruitment;
development of digital instruments for the experiment (e.g.
applications, websites, games); factors of participants
behaviour (e.g. engagement, drop-out, completion rate).

Participants will be allowed to discuss both research in
progress and completed studies.

### Audience

This workshop is intended for PhD students and scholars at any
stage of their career who are interested in the online
experiments. Participants may have varying research backgrounds
(e.g. media and communication studies, sociology, social
psychology, political science), but are expected to have a good
command of quantitative approaches and a broader involvement in
Web science. 

## How to apply

To register for the workshop, please follow the guidelines on
the WebSci’21 website: [websci21.webscience.org](https://websci21.webscience.org).

To apply as a panelist, you need to submit an extended abstract (~1000 words) of your presentation (no full papers are required). We ask you to send abstracts (pdf) to scila.websci21@gmail.com; no special formatting is necessary. Please, do not forget to identify your name, position, and affiliation in the letter. __Abstract submission deadline &mdash; April 23, 2021__.
