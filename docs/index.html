            <p class="text-base py-3">
                Providing access to diverse populations and being cost-efficient,
                online experiments have been widely used to solve various problems
                in social sciences. This research method has been especially
                prevalent in Web science and digital communication research allowing
                to study human interactions with and within the Web environment.
                Among all, online experiments have been used to explore online
                behaviour, information perception, social media use, to name a few.
                However, such designs raise a number of methodological challenges —
                both conceptual and technical. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                This workshop (hosted by the 13th Web Science Conference 2021) is
                dedicated to the methodology of online experiments. It will bring
                together researchers from various fields with an expertise in online
                experimental designs who will present their studies and share
                experience in methodological problem solving. The goal of the
                workshop is to discuss different approaches towards designing
                Web-based experiments as well as their affordances and limitations.
            </p>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                The event will start from the presentation given by the
                organizers: the SCILa team will share its experience of
                conducting a cross-national online experiment based on the
                recent <a class="text-blue-800 font-bold underline" href="https://scila.hse.ru/en/fakenews">study on the perception of fake news in three countries</a>.
                In particular, we will discuss possible factorial designs,
                representative sample construction, recruitment via targeting
                tools on social media, and online experiment interface
                development and testing. Followed by the presentations of other
                panelists, the workshop will end with an extensive discussion
                session where participants will have an opportunity to advise
                each other and exchange broader ideas on the use of experiments
                in Web science. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl py-3">Program</h3>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                The estimated time of the workshop is between 3 and 4 hours. The
                detailed program will be announced after the review of
                applications is finished. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-extrabold text-2xl py-2">Who can apply</h3>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-xl py-2">Panelists</h4>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                We will select up to 5 participants who will present their
                research during the workshop. The application needs to meet
                several requirements: 
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside px-5">
                <li>study is based on an online experiment as a primary method;</li>
                <li>data has been already collected;</li>
                <li>projects that are relevant to the thematic areas of the WebSci conference are strongly encouraged.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                The proposed presentations are expected to cover methodological
                aspects of online experiments such as but not limited to: choice
                of a design; sample construction and methods of recruitment;
                development of digital instruments for the experiment (e.g.
                applications, websites, games); factors of participants
                behaviour (e.g. engagement, drop-out, completion rate). 
            </p>

            <p class="text-base py-3">
                Participants will be allowed to discuss both research in
                progress and completed studies. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-xl py-2">Audience</h4>

                (e.g. media and communication studies, sociology, social
                psychology, political science), but are expected to have a good
                command of quantitative approaches and a broader involvement in
                Web science.
